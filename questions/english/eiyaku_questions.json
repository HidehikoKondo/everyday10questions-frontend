{"questions":[{"question":"下記の文書を英訳してください。","answer":"choice1","hint":"未来の予定を表す表現と、「荷造りをする」の動詞句に注目しましょう。","explanation":"「～する予定である」という未来の予定や意思を表す場合、\"be going to\"を用いるのが自然です。また、「荷造りをする」は\"pack one's things\"や\"pack one's bags\"と表現します。選択肢1が最も適切です。","choice1":"He is going to move next week, so I am going to help him pack his things.","choice2":"He will move next week, so I will help him pack his things.","choice3":"He moves next week, so I help him pack his things.","choice4":"He is moving next week, so I will help him pack his things.","scope":"「未来の予定」の問題です。","text":"彼は来週引っ越す予定なので、荷造りを手伝ってあげるつもりです。"},{"question":"下記の文書を英訳してください。","answer":"choice2","hint":"「～するのに時間がかかる」という構文と、本の感想を述べる表現を考えましょう。","explanation":"「～するのに時間がかかる」は\"It takes/took (人) 時間 to do ～\"の構文を使うのが一般的です。選択肢2がこの構文を正しく用いています。","choice1":"This book took a long time to finish reading, but it was very interesting.","choice2":"It took me a long time to read this book, but it was very interesting.","choice3":"I spent a long time finishing this book, but it was very interesting.","choice4":"To finish reading this book took a long time, but it was very interesting.","scope":"「所要時間と感想」の問題です。","text":"この本は読み終えるまでに時間がかかりましたが、とても面白かったです。"},{"question":"下記の文書を英訳してください。","answer":"choice1","hint":"「～にもかかわらず」を表す接続詞や前置詞の使い分けに注意しましょう。","explanation":"「～にもかかわらず」を表す接続詞は\"although\"や\"even though\"、\"though\"が適切です。\"despite\"は前置詞なので、\"despite the rain\"や\"despite the fact that it was raining\"のように名詞句や\"the fact that S+V\"が後に続きます。選択肢1の\"Although it was raining\"が文法的に正しく、意味も合致しています。","choice1":"Although it was raining, we went on a picnic.","choice2":"Despite it was raining, we went on a picnic.","choice3":"Even if it was raining, we went on a picnic.","choice4":"While it was raining, we went on a picnic.","scope":"「逆接の表現」の問題です。","text":"雨が降っていたにもかかわらず、私たちはピクニックに出かけました。"}]}
