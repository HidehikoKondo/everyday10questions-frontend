However, its widespread use has led to a serious environmental problem: plastic pollution. Millions of tons of plastic waste are produced every year, and much of it ends up in oceans and landfills. Once in the environment, plastic breaks down into tiny pieces called microplastics. These microplastics can be eaten by marine animals, harming them and entering the food chain, which can eventually affect humans. Also, plastic waste can block waterways and pollute soil, impacting ecosystems. Recycling is one way to deal with this problem, but not all plastic can be recycled easily. A more effective approach is to reduce our use of single-use plastics. For example, carrying a reusable water bottle and shopping bag can make a big difference. Governments and companies are also working to develop biodegradable plastics and better waste management systems. Addressing plastic pollution requires effort from everyone."},{"question":"下記の文章によると、祇園祭の主な目的は何でしたか。最も適切なものを選択肢の中から選びなさい。","answer":"choice1","hint":"祇園祭の「始まり」についての記述に注目しましょう。","explanation":"文章の2段落目に「Originally, the festival started in the 9th century as a purification ritual to pray for protection from plagues and natural disasters. (元々、この祭りは9世紀に疫病や自然災害からの保護を祈る清めの儀式として始まりました。)」と明記されています。","choice1":"疫病や自然災害から人々を守ることを祈ること","choice2":"地元の芸術家が作品を発表する機会を提供すること","choice3":"美しい山鉾の装飾技術を世界に示すこと","choice4":"京都市の観光客を増やすこと","scope":"文化・伝統に関する長文読解の問題です。","text":"Japan is rich in traditional festivals, and one of the most famous is the Gion Matsuri in Kyoto. Held every July, it has a history of over a thousand years and is known as one of Japan's largest and oldest festivals. Originally, the festival started in the 9th century as a purification ritual to pray for protection from plagues and natural disasters. The highlight of the Gion Matsuri is the \"Yamaboko Junko,\" a grand parade featuring beautifully decorated floats called \"yamaboko.\" These floats are works of art, some reaching over 20 meters high, adorned with tapestries, carvings, and historical artifacts. Musicians play traditional instruments, and people in traditional costumes pull the heavy floats through the streets of Kyoto. Before the main parade, the \"Yoiyama\" evenings are held. During this time, the streets are closed to traffic, and the floats are displayed. Locals open their houses, showing off family treasures, creating a lively atmosphere where people enjoy food, drinks, and traditional music. The Gion Matsuri is not just a spectacle; it's a vibrant cultural event that connects people with their history and community."},{"question":"下記の文章によると、再利用可能なロケットの主な利点は何ですか。最も適切なものを選択肢の中から選びなさい。","answer":"choice3","hint":"再利用可能なロケットについて説明されている部分をよく読んでください。","explanation":"文章の3段落目に「This significantly reduces the cost of launching payloads into space, making missions to the Moon and Mars more feasible. (これにより、宇宙へ積荷を打ち上げるコストが大幅に削減され、月や火星へのミッションがより実現可能になります。)」と書かれています。したがって、コスト削減が主な利点です。","choice1":"宇宙空間での速度を向上させること","choice2":"宇宙飛行士の安全性を高めること","choice3":"宇宙への打ち上げ費用を大幅に削減すること","choice4":"より多くの燃料を搭載できるようになること","scope":"科学・テクノロジーに関する長文読解の問題です。","text":"For centuries, humanity has looked up at the stars and dreamed of exploring beyond Earth. Today, space travel is no longer just a dream but a reality, and the future holds even more exciting possibilities. Companies and governments are investing heavily in new technologies to make space travel more accessible and sustainable. One major focus is developing reusable rockets. Unlike traditional rockets that are discarded after a single use, reusable rockets can land back on Earth and be prepared for another flight. This significantly reduces the cost of launching payloads into space, making missions to the Moon and Mars more feasible. Another area of innovation is in propulsion systems. Scientists are researching faster and more efficient ways to travel across vast cosmic distances, such as electric propulsion or even warp drive concepts, though the latter is still largely theoretical. Beyond exploration, space travel also offers potential for space tourism, asteroid mining, and building new habitats off-Earth. As technology advances, our reach into the cosmos will continue to expand."}]}
